Forte is a web app that tackles community and music! 👯‍♀️ Our mission is to give YOU the space to talk about your favorite songs with your friends and connect with them in a way that is inviting, and also not scary at all! (Post about the song **YOU WANT** that person to see 👀) 

### Getting Started 💫
To get stared, create an account on the application! You'll be redirected to the main news feed where you'll be able to see the song that your friends have posted for the day, and make a music post of your own. 

You can search a song on Spotify, and add a description. Your post will save, and is now uploaded! 

Go to your profile to access your old, posted songs in the archive, and edit your username! **This is what you share to add friends!** You can then check in the app, once a day to see what songs your friends are posting. 🎥

## How we Built it 🛠
Forte was build with a typical MERN template using 
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React (Vite powered) 
- Node.js 
- Axios

and using the following frameworks 
- Bootstrap
- Semantic UI
- TailwindCSS 

Unlike a CRA or bundler-based build setup, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) does not build the entire application before serving. It divides the application modules into two categories: dependencies and source code! It has an improved build preformance hat we wanted to tackle working with! ✨✨
